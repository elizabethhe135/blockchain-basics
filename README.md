# blockchain-basics

I took an Intro to blockchain computer science class at college and decided to put together some intro projects (e.g., smart contracts) that I wrote using Solidity language.

I'd love to discuss my projects with anyone interested! Please reach me at this email: he.tianyi318@gmail.com
